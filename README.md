# VisionOfLabor

Vision of Labor is an application to help users more equitably divide and manage the chores for their household. Using data generated from the app, users can more easily have conversations around who should be doing what, and how frequently, so that household duties are both visualized and more evenly distributed. 

When a user logs in to the app, they see common household chores that they can add to their household, avoiding having to add every chore manually. Users can also add custom chores if the pre-existing options do not fully represent what they need.
